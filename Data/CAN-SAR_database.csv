Identify extent of groundwater recharge area. Measure flows of seeps and streams occupied by dusky salamanders to determine seasonal and yearly averages. Have source water protection (both surface and ground water) for land in the upgradient tableland areas. Ensure that all development activities on adjacent land that may involve contaminating or lowering of the groundwater table are monitored for groundwater impacts. Control quantity and quality of stormwater discharge from adjacent land including industrial, recreational and urban areas: eliminate the application of herbicides and pesticides in the vicinity of seeps; monitor stormwater quality for pollutants; develop an emergency spills action plan for the area; create wetland areas to capture and slow down stormwater run-off; plant native trees to stabilize the slope. Monitor erosion rates on the hillsides where salamanders are found for indications of slope instability. Ensure that forest canopy remains intact. Discourage park visitors from off-trail hiking. Investigate and implement best management practices for removal of European Common Reed.
2. Conduct a thorough population study, and if necessary maintain the genetic health of Allegheny Mountain Dusky Salamander and Northern Dusky Salamander populations in Ontario.
Conduct a thorough population study to determine more accurate population size and trends for each species in Ontario: may involve mark-recapture fieldwork and/or genetic analysis. Monitor genetic health of populations: check for inbreeding with genetic analysis every 25 years. If inbreeding appears to be a concern, look into the feasibility of salamander introductions from New York State, which is the nearest population source. Search suitable/accessible habitat in Niagara Gorge for any additional populations of dusky salamanders.
3. Locate additional populations, and expand the current ranges of Allegheny Mountain Dusky Salamanders and Northern Dusky Salamanders through introductions where appropriate.
Research the probability of success if individuals are translocated from sites outside of Ontario to suitable unoccupied habitats: determine likelihood of survival; establish what numbers would be needed for a successful introduction and if they can be moved; research other potential barriers to introductions; identify areas with no obvious impediments to re-establishment; investigate potential habitat along the Niagara Escarpment and Fonthill Kame Morraine.  If potential habitat is found (and successful introduction seems likely), pilot an introduction project.

4. Elicit public support and collaboration in the protection and recovery of Allegheny Mountain Dusky Salamanders and Northern Dusky Salamanders in Ontario.
Prepare educational materials such as pamphlets to inform park visitors about the endangered status of these salamanders and the need to not disturb them or their habitat.

Generally findings indicate that aerial invertebrates have lower diversity and abundance in homogenized agricultural landscapes. However, agricultural land is a small component of Black Swift range during breeding. K. Potter suggested that most of the area in the western Amazon basin where swifts from Colorado overwinter has not been developed - and has low road density (dirt roads etc.). There is much more extensive development in the eastern Amazon basin (see maps in Soares-Filho et al. 2006). However, there is a possibility that swifts from Canada overwinter in a different area that is affected by this factor. The other recent sighting of Black Swift in South America was in Tambopata National Reserve in Peru - which is within the kernel areas of the wintering birds from Colorado.",0,NA,NA,NA,NA,n/a,1,1,1,2,4,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,n/a,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Although no Black Swifts have apparently been killed by wind turbines, mortality has occurred in other swift species. For example, Vaux’s Swifts and White-throated Swifts were killed by wind turbines in Washington and Oregon (Johnson and Erickson 2011). Compared to other bird species (particularly passerines and raptors) the numbers of individuals that would be killed is quite low, perhaps partly because of the height at which swifts generally forage and also because of their flight speeds and maneuverability. Recent information suggests that much larger numbers of birds (and bats) are killed by wind turbines than has previously been estimated (Smallwood 2013). However, compared to other threats to Black Swifts, this would be considered of low impact.",1,NA,1,1,2,4,NA,1,1,1,2,4,"Infrastructure also causes habitat loss and fragmentation which could cumulatively affect invertebrate food supply for swifts. It also affects run-off and thus could affect water supply to swift nesting sites.

It may depend on the type of logging - over time removal of older trees could affect invertebrate numbers, if average stand age decreases. It has been shown that ant nest densities in British Columbia are higher where large wood structures (trees, logs, stumps) occur and since ants are thought to be an important component of Black Swift diet, logging (which reduces wood volume) may have a negative effect. Also there could be an impact on hydrology - increased run-off and pulse events. Initially logging could result in increased volume of stream flow but later flow could dry up. Lack of transpiration is another issue. These could affect stream flow at nest sites (water is a critical component at nesting sites) or invertebrate food supply. Deforestation is occurring on east slopes coastal range in BC. Also in Amazon basin but deforestation here may be an issue over longer term (not next 10 years).",0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,1,1,1,4,NA,1,1,1,1,4,"Human disturbance probably has a neglible impact but important to note that there are different types of disturbance (people walking on trails to rock climbing, caving). Some nest sites may be disturbed by rock climbers or cavers. Although rock climbing could be a threat (Remsen 1978), many nest sites are on wet, slippery and mossy substrates and so dangerous to climb. In Johnston Canyon, Alberta, some nests can be observed at eye level from the trail and swifts remain on the nest despite numerous passers-by (Jason Rogers, pers. comm. 2013). At one site in Johnston Canyon, a stick had apparently been thrown at the nest and was lodged in a crevice (Jason Rogers, pers. comm. 2013). (A thrown rock was reported to have destroyed a nest in southern California (Foerster 1987; Lowther and Collins 2002)). There is a possibility that people using flash photography to take photographs of Black Swifts nestlings could disturb nestlings, especially if they are near to fledging, and they could fall into the creek below (Jason Rogers, pers. comm. 2013). Johnston canyon on its own is only a small percentage of the Canadian population. Human disturbance is not believed to be a a threat to nesting birds here (as 1000s of people a day go through this site and birds seem unaffected). The nesting colony in Johnston Canyon is already precarious (1 breeding pair, failed in 2013) and the decline is not believed to be related to disturbance since birds were already nesting there in the 1970s and construction equipment, including ropes on rock faces were installed and did not apparently affect the birds.

The consensus was that pesticides could have impact over next 10 years (severe to moderate) but really unknown. It could be as high as 70%, but telecom participants were happier with 'unknown'. Although agriculture occurs in relatively small part of Black Swifts breeding range - airborne pollutants can be detected at great distances from the original source and have impacts over large geographical areas. Despite their different life histories and geographic distributions, aerial insectivores are declining as a group. One common threat that has been identified but not proven is the role of insecticides. In particular there has been concern over the Neonicotinoid insecticides which have extremely high toxicity to invertebrates (e.g., believed to have decimated bee populations; they have also recently been shown to interfere with behaviour of ant species). These pesticides are very likely to affect other invertebrates too and thus they could have an indirect food-mediated impact on Black Swifts, but could also cause direct mortality.",0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,1,5,1,4,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,this was dealt with in ecosystem change,1,1,5,1,4,Over the longer term this could be a larger threat to this species.

If warmer winters result in increased survival this could have knock on effects on insect phenology. The timing of Black Swift breeding may have evolved to coincide with phenology of invertebrate populations (e.g., early summer emergence or nuptial swarming of ants) and there may be a mis-match. This may not be an issue over next 10 years but will definitely cause issues in the longer term (potential impact will be higher - see climate models). It is questionable whether or not it may be an issue in the next 10 years since the rate of climate change may be increasing. Moreover, there are some data to suggest that phenological changes in response to warming can occur within a relatively short time period. There are also data from some bird species that show that they cannot adapt as rapidly to changes in climate as can invertebrates.",1,-1,3,-1,3,effects are likely to be very local (i.e..

Recovery techniques, including habitat protection, habitat restoration and various threat reduction techniques can be used to achieve population and distribution objectives in a reasonable time frame. Habitat securement will require a stewardship approach that engages the voluntary cooperation of landowners and managers on various land tenures to protect this species and the habitat upon which it relies. It may include stewardship agreements, conservation covenants, ecological gifts, voluntary sale of private lands by willing landowners, land use designations, protected areas, management agreements, and existing legislation. Addressing knowledge gaps in relation to distribution and habitat use is important for identifying sites for securement.

Objective 2: Communicate and exchange information on an ongoing basis between parties using a collaborative and coordinated approach.
Objective 3: Collect information to fill knowledge gaps on Dolphin and Union Caribou using IQ and TK, community monitoring and scientific methods.
Objective 4: Minimize disturbance to habitat and preserve sea ice crossings to maintain the ability of Dolphin and Union Caribou to move freely across their range. (Proactively work with marine/industry/transportation organizations and regulators to minimize human and industrial disturbance and seek ways to preserve sea ice crossings. Manage populations of other species that affect Dolphin and Union Caribou habitat.)
Objective 5: Ensure management is based on population level so future generations can benefit from sustainable harvesting opportunities. (Manage harvesting activities within acceptable limits using adaptive management techniques included in Section 6, to ensure that harvesting opportunities are available in the future and treaty rights are fully respected. Manage predators using adaptive management techniques included in Section 6 as a natural and necessary part of the ecosystem. )
Harvest management and other management actions should also be informed by the level and trend of the population. This management plan recommends a framework describing how management actions should be adapted at different phases in the Dolphin and Union Caribou cycle, according to when the population is increasing, high, decreasing or low.
There are already some measures in place that assist in managing Dolphin and Union Caribou, including land claim agreements, legislation, regulations, community conservation plans, and land use planning.

Some of the threats to Dolphin and Union Caribou such as climate change, pollution and contaminants are broad in scope and cannot be directly addressed by this management plan. Since these range-wide threats are caused by humankind, national and international cooperation and collaboration should be promoted to help mitigate them. The impact of these threats on Dolphin and Union Caribou should be highlighted through the appropriate regional, national and international fora.  In addressing these threats, all management partners will need to work collaboratively and can choose to work on approaches and actions that are most suitable for their particular organisation’s mandate.

With regard to severity, “moderate-slight” was used to denote uncertainty. Mortalities have been signaled in Quebec and in Ontario.",1,1,2,1,4,The assessment of the scope of this threat (including for example power transmission lines and pipelines) includes only the new structures that might be built and associated rights-of-way.

The scope “large” rather than “pervasive” is explained by the fact that a large proportion of the packs have territories located largely in areas where hunting and trapping are prohibited. For severity, the range “serious-moderate” was used to denote uncertainty. Ontario: when wolves leave areas where hunting and trapping are prohibited, the threats they face are much greater.

","General Description of Research and Management Approaches: Prioritize historical sites for restoration based on capacity to support metapopulation; Develop and implement site-specific restoration and management plans for historical Karner Blue sites to maintain and expand suitable habitat; Building on the existing St. Williams Conservation Reserve Management Plan, develop species-specific restoration and management goals for Frosted Elfin; Create or restore dispersal habitat to connect suitable habitat; Where possible and appropriate, secure additional land adjacent to historically known habitat to increase habitat available for habitat restoration and/or creation and to allow for expansion of existing historic locations in order to meet the medium-term population and distribution objective; Identify additional sites which provide habitat for Frosted Elfin and Karner Blue, and develop and implement site-specific management and restoration plans including: Restoration/management plans which allow for reintroduction at additional non-historic locations where suitable habitat is already being restored for the purpose of recovery; Restore additional habitat areas to meet long term population and distribution objective through known restoration techniques (e.g., controlled burns, vegetation clearing, and planting of Wild Lupines); Control excessive Wild Lupine browsing
Conduct research on the following:
Frosted Elfin
minimum viable population size necessary to fully recover Frosted Elfin at potential reintroduction site(s); associations with larval-tending ants and the potential implications of the exotic European Fire Ant to Frosted Elfin; habitat patch size and movement patterns within and between patches by Frosted Elfin; habitat interactions at potential reintroduction site(s) such as oviposition sites, larval development success and relation to canopy cover, nectar plant associations, etc.; extent of interspecific competition for food resources during caterpillar life stage, including impact of the cannibalistic nature of Frosted Elfin caterpillars on other butterfly species; potential impacts of recreational activities on reintroduced populations; understanding the biophysical attributes of pupation sites, emergence timing, Wild Lupine/nectar plant availability, and weather-linked changes in Frosted Elfin activity at potential reintroduction sites; captive-breeding requirements and reintroduction techniques to help inform feasibility of reintroduction; 
Develop and deliver stewardship initiatives to protect suitable habitat; Work collaboratively with stakeholders including landowners, conservation authorities, municipalities, government and non-government organizations, and First Nations to protect and manage suitable habitat; Develop and implement Best Management Practices for Karner Blue and Frosted Elfin suitable habitat; Develop and implement site-specific invasive species management plans according to Best Management Practices for Karner Blue and Frosted Elfin; Monitor the success of habitat restoration and management activities (e.g., whether sufficient suitable habitat has been restored/ managed to support a metapopulation of Karner Blue and/or Frosted Elfin). Monitor the status of threats, such as invasive species, larval foodplant defoliation, pesticide/herbicide drift unauthorized collection, and off-road vehicle use in suitable habitat. Engage landowners, land managers and First Nations in discussions about Karner Blue and Frosted Elfin, in the importance of recovery, threats, and techniques to recover the species and their habitats; Encourage the planting of Wild Lupine and appropriate native nectaring flowers by local landowners; If reintroduction is determined to be necessary and biologically and technically feasible: Develop communication strategies for the reintroduction of Karner Blue and Frosted Elfin; Develop a training program for wildlife enforcement officers to educate them on the location of potential reintroduction sites and the identification of the species

To help protect and recover Gattinger's Agalinis and Houghton's Goldenrod, the government will directly undertake the following actions: continue to manage the habitat of Gattinger's Agalinis and Houghton's Goldenrod in provincially protected areas to maintain the ecological integrity of their habitats and to minimize the threat of recreational pressures and impacts; continue to implement the Ontario Invasive Species Strategic Plan to address the invasive species (e.g., Common Reed) that threaten Gattinger's Agalinis and Houghton's Goldenrod; educate other agencies and authorities involved in planning and environmental assessment processes on the protection requirements under the ESA; encourage the submission of Gattinger's Agalinis and Houghton's Goldenrod data to the Ministry's central repository at the Natural Heritage Information Centre; undertake communications and outreach to increase public awareness of species at risk in Ontario; protect Gattinger's Agalinis and Houghton's Goldenrod and their habitat through the ESA; develop direction to provide greater clarity to proponents and partners on the areas of general habitat protected under the ESA for plant species at risk; support conservation, agency, municipal and industry partners, and Aboriginal communities and organizations to undertake activities to protect and recover Gattinger's Agalinis and Houghton's Goldenrod. Support will be provided where appropriate through funding, agreements, permits (including conditions) and/or advisory services; encourage collaboration, and establish and communicate annual priority actions for government support in order to reduce duplication of efforts.

One patch at one site was extirpated by the widening of an ATV trail. No new ATV trails are expected.

Drainage ditches could dry out the soil where individuals are found, which is not ideal for this species, which prefers more moist conditions. The plants seem to be able to recover if dry conditions are only temporary, although less moisture could also affect seedling establishment.

OKANAGAN: Conversion of land into vineyards, orchards & other agricultural uses has led to the loss of breeding habitat in the past, but development has slowed since the early 2000s; intensification and redevelopment of existing agricultural sites continues. In addition to habitat loss and degradation, accidental mortality can increase in existing agricultural areas that spadefoots continue to use for travel routes or other purposes: Irrigation system control pits (10 to 12/10-acre farm) can act as deadly pitfall traps on irrigated lands (Ashpole pers. comm. 2012).

On a positive note, some of the historical dugouts created years ago for water source for livestock are providing some of the more secure breeding habitats for spadefoots during droughts. THOMPSON/NICOLA: scope 71%+ (J. Surgenor pers. comm. 2011). OKANAGAN: Scope pervasive; cattle are even at higher elevations (71-100%) (O. Dyer pers. comm. 2011). Severity: Livestock can have both adverse and beneficial effects, but adverse effects are of overriding importance, especially in shallow water bodies. Severity of impacts depends on stocking density and duration of grazing season, and effects are expected to be more damaging in drought years. Livestock grazing can impact grassland species presence and composition and reduce the amount of bare ground available to spadefoots (ecosystem effects are included under 7.3). Research should be conducted to determine livestock stocking rates that are compatible with the maintenance of suitable spadefoot retreat habitats.

Crosby (2014) found re: HWY 97 twinning near Oliver that this species represented 87.4% of the amphibians found on the roadways; 46.5% of the amphibians found on road were dead (most were adults; metamorphs constituted a small proportion); mortality continued to occur at a lower level after mitigation. Roadkill is highly variable across the species' range and can be significant at local sites, but population effects have been seldom, if ever, documented. Therefore, a wide range is included in the severity rating, for which there is much uncertainty. There is no evidence of declines or case studies of populations near busy roads, but the species seems to persist; immigration from adjacent areas is a possibility. Impact of metamorph roadkill to population declines is unstudied.

Salvage harvesting associated Mountain Pine beetle, in particular, was extensive up to 2014 and may continue but is possibly mostly done. In the Cariboo, spadefoots are found at forest edges but don't spend much time in forest, reducing scope for this threat. THOMPSON-NICOLA and OKANAGAN: Salvage harvesting occurs in higher elevations, but scope is negligible. Severity: Impacts are mostly from disturbing wetland breeding habitats and spadefoots there during logging activities. In the Cariboo, existing wildlife measures allow forest harvesting to occur during any season of the year, but within WHAs it should be restricted to winter harvest to prevent spadefoot mortality from surface harvesting activities (R.

Severity: Impacts are from direct mortality and habitat degradation at breeding sites; effects on burrowed spadefoots in terrestrial habitat are unknown (1 case of radio-tracked burrowed spadefoot apparently killed). Habitat degradation includes compressing the loose sandy soils that spadefoots need for burrowing and altering shallow breeding sites to create sink habitats (effects similar to cattle trampling).

OKANAGAN: Mostly related to people drawing water with scope Small and close to 1%. Water withdrawal usually occurs after breeding by spadefoots have been completed. Unauthorized dam removal is ongoing and could result in breeding site destruction. Severity: Impacts are from water withdrawal for irrigation, which is a prime driver in agricultural areas, or for other purposes, as well as from alteration of natural water regimes. These range from draining ponds to altering natural patterns of wetland persistence, hydroperiods, and water levels. Sink habitats may be created by making ponds permanent or creating them in unsuitable landscape contexts.

Conifer encroachment on grasslands is not considered a problem over the next 10 years but may become one over the long term.",1,NA,2,5,2,4,NA,1,2,5,2,4,"Non-native fish and disease organisms, particularly Bd, pose widespread potential threats, and bullfrogs are a potential threat in the Okanagan. Diseases: No disease outbreaks are known to affect the BC spadefoots, but epidemic disease must now be considered a serious threat to all amphibian populations; hence the scope is pervasive (following practice for other species assessments). The fungus is widespread in amphibians across BC and also occurs in South Okanagan (Govindarajulu et al. 2013; Richardson et al. 2014). In 2008, 14.3% of 35 Spadefoot tadpoles tested in B.C. tested positive for Bd (Richardson et al. 2014), but whether this leads to mortality is unknown (P. Govindarajulu, pers. comm. 2014). Ranavirus has been found in other spadefoot species (Spea bombifrons in Kansas). Sport fish or other fish for mosquito control or other purposes continue to be introduced to spadefoot habitats or to larger water bodies from where they can spread. Spadefoots are somewhat protected from fish because of their extensive use of shallow temporary water bodies; scope would be less based on fish only. OKANAGAN: Spread of non-native fish has been extensive in the South Okanagan (M. Herborg 2012). Small breeding wetland are usually fishless, but most ponds that can support fish will eventually get fish. BC Ministry is no longer planning to stock some ponds that may become habitable in the future, but most are high-elevation sites and may not help spadefoots. Fish introduction is also conducted for mosquito control purposes (bulletin put out by the Health Ministry suggested introducing fish into ponds for mosquito control in response to West Nile virus). Bullfrog threat has reduced dramatically due to eradication efforts. Severity: Much uncertainty; scored slight based mainly on threat from fish, which suggests that severity is >1% (known effects, e.g., local disappearances after Goldfish introduction). Severity of potential threat from disease (no outbreaks recorded yet) is hard to predict; spadefoots may be protected to some degree by spending much time in the terrestrial habitats and extensively using temporary habitats; disease transmission may be more of an issue if forced to use permanent waters, e.g., by droughts, but there is no evidence.",0,NA,NA,NA,NA,Trout stocking of ponds with species native to BC (but not necessarily to the areas in question) are discussed under non-native species under 8.1.,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,2.5,3.5,2.5,4,NA,1,1,1,-1,4,"A large historical breeding population was in sewage lagoon (Osoyoos), but this population seems to be in decline (note: original estimates of this population size were an approximation).

Herbicides are also used in forestry, but most likely not in spadefoot habitats. Agricultural: Bishop et al. (2010) detected low concentrations of 17 chemicals in amphibian breeding sites at orchards in the South Okanagan; both organic and treated orchards had contaminants. Spadefoot hatching success was variable: 0-92% in sprayed orchards; 48-98.6% in organic orchards; 51-95.5% at reference sites. Atrazine alone and atrazine, total nitrate, and chlorpyrifos accounted for ~80% of the variation in hatching success. Field evidence for declines in agricultural areas is lacking, but data are crude, and source-sink population dynamics confuse the picture. Nonlethal impacts of a variety of pollutants on amphibians are well documented. Tadpoles are affected, but there is uncertainty about population effects; where adults are exposed to pesticides in fields, there could be cumulative effects. Mosquito control: Widespread insecticide applications (i.e., Vectobac, Malathion) as part of mosquito control programs to control spread of the West Nile virus is a developing issue. Scope reflects the area of lands under agriculture (existing and projected). Severity: The group discussed severity at length; a range was used to reflect uncertainty; the upper value would be at lower end of moderate (just over 10%), but there are no data.

All these factors suggest high vulnerability to climate change.

A decrease in the water table is likely to either eliminate temporary shallow water bodies or shorten their hydro-period and accentuate effects of periodic droughts. Changes are already happening but will become a greater issue over the long term (>10 years). The reductions in water supply are predicted to be modest during the 2020s, but would become more severe during the 2050s and 2080s (Cohen 2004). Over the past decade, a significant number of small wetlands across the species' range in BC have gone dry or almost dry. A decreasing trend in the number of Great Basin Spadefoot breeding ponds was noted in several areas of the Okanagan during a period of long drought that ended circa 2013 (Dyer pers. comm. 2019); however, this trend may have been reversed in the subsequent wetter years. Scope: Although all areas of the range are affected, not all habitats are affected equally (permanent water bodies are least affected), hence scope has uncertainty and less than pervasive); Severity - Might be extreme in shallow water bodies in cases where drought continues for several years, but many areas have multiple wetlands with different depths within migration distance of spadefoots. A wide range is used for severity to capture this uncertainty.",1,-1,-1,-1,3,"Spadefoots are fairly tolerant and occur much farther south, where temperatures are routinely much higher than in BC. A study with Northern Red-legged Frog (Rana aurora), Great Basin Spadefoot, and Pacific Treefrog as model organisms indicates that all these species have thermal safety margins in BC of 3.2–3.8 °C, based on current maximum summer temperatures, but that the margins will rapidly erode at a rate of 0.5 °C per decade with climate change, leading to a high proportion of each species’ range experiencing temperatures above optimal by the 2080s (Gerick et al. 2014). Spadefoots in some lower elevation habitats in the southern portion of their range might already have little or no thermal safety margins (Fig 2 in Gerick et al. 2014). Actual mechanisms of impacts are complex and include interactions among temperature, rate of pond drying, and survival - some effects of increased temperature are positive (O'Regan et al. 2014).

Habitat mapping – The location of nesting (woodland) and foraging habitat (eelgrass beds, freshwater and estuarine marshes, grassy habitats, ditches, and riversides) needs to be mapped to support its conservation by responsible jurisdictions and landowners. Mapping also needs to be done to identify habitat that should be set aside for future nesting (alternate habitat is required because Pacific Great Blue Heron colonies move locations from time to time).
Habitat conservation – Those habitats considered necessary for conservation of the species, including existing and alternate habitat, need to be conserved. Since many Pacific Great Blue Heron colonies are on private land, a program of incentives (such as Natural Areas Protection Tax Exemption Program and Ecological Gifts Program) could provide landowners with the impetus to protect nesting trees and buffers. Land stewardship agreements and both provincial and federal protection should be pursued for nesting and foraging grounds (e.g., via mechanisms such as Wildlife Habitat Areas and Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs).
Habitat stewardship and education – Outreach with individual landowners (to inform them of the species’ needs and encourage them to adjust landscaping and other activities) is needed to reduce disturbance and habitat loss for birds that nest on/adjacent to private land. Interpretive signage and community meetings also will build awareness of the negative effects of human recreation on foraging Pacific Great Blue Herons.
Research and monitoring to fill knowledge gaps – The current monitoring program must be continued and enhancements made to ensure that reliable population estimates can be generated and appropriate management targets established for all Conservation Regions. Research is required to assess potential methods for mitigation of threats from human disturbance and Bald Eagle predation (CDC 2014), as well as the importance of emerging industrial contaminants (such as PBDEs; COSEWIC 2008). The threat from Bald Eagle predation is not well understood currently, so, until further research is conducted, it is not clear what appropriate mitigation options (if any) can be employed. Population modeling is required to better understand the metapopulation dynamics between Haida Gwaii, Mainland Coast, Vancouver Island, and Lower Fraser River Valley and the numbers required for viability in each of these Conservation Regions. Juvenile herons from wildlife rescues might be able to increase recruitment in some populations; however, more research into this technique is required.

Habitat restoration – The restoration of marine (e.g., eelgrass enhancement, spartina removal) and upland (e.g., planting old field and grassy cover that promote small mammal populations) foraging habitats in the more heavily-developed areas of the coast (especially in the Lower Fraser River Valley), as well as selected habitats by planting alders or other beneficial vegetation, will help to ensure that priority nesting and foraging locations remain as functional as possible. This may help to reduce the risk of colonies frequently relocating and provide mature trees for nesting in the future.",0,NA,NA,"Outreach and stewardship, Research and monitoring, Habitat management, Population management",NA,1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,1,1.1,NA,NA,NA,NA,Medium,NA,NA,1,NA,2,2,3.5,4,NA,1,2,2,2.5,4,NA,1,2,2,3.5,4,NA,1,1,1,2.5,4,NA,1,NA,2,2,4.5,4,NA,1,1,1,4.5,4,NA,1,1,1,4.5,4,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,2,2,2.5,4,NA,1,NA,1,1,4.5,3,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,4.5,3,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,2,4,2,4,NA,1,2,4,2,4,NA,1,2,4,2,4,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,2,4,NA,1,NA,2,2,2,4,NA,1,1,2,1,4,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,2,2,2,4,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,2,4,2,4,NA,1,2,4,2,4,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,2,4,NA,1,NA,1,2,1,4,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,2,1,4,NA,1,1,1,-1,4,NA,1,NA,3,5,3,4,NA,1,1,1,-1,4,NA,1,3,5,3,4,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,-1,5,-1,4,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,-1,5,-1,4,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

High timing because these practices are continuing.,1,3,3,5,4,"The introduction and use of the highly successful Common Eastern Bumble Bee (B. impatiens) for pollination services in western Canada may further impact declining host populations of Western Bumble Bee and Yellow-banded Bumble Bee. Common Eastern Bumble Bee may out-compete native bee species for nesting habitat or forage resources, and may serve as a pathogen or disease source. The status of establishment of wild populations of Common Eastern Bumble Bee in western Canada is unknown, but likely to have a negative impact on native species, as has been documented in other parts of the world (Williams and Osborne 2009). Pathogen spillover is implicated in the significant declines of many animals (Morton et al. 2004; Power and Mitchell 2004) but is a poorly understood threat for bumble bees. Pathogen spillover occurs when pathogens spread from a heavily infected ‘reservoir’ host population to a sympatric ‘non-reservoir’ host population (Power and Mitchell 2004). The use of infected commercial bumble bees (e.g., Common Eastern Bumble Bee in Canada) for greenhouse pollination is known to cause pathogen spillover into populations of wild bumble bees foraging nearby (Colla et al. 2006; Otterstatter and Thomson 2008). Lab studies have shown the parasite species Crithidia bombi and Nosema bombi (suspected) have devastating effect on Bombus colony-founding queens, foraging workers and entire nests (Brown et al. 2000, 2003; Otterstatter et al. 2005). These parasites are found in a variety of bumble bee species (Macfarlane 1974; Macfarlane et al. 1995; Colla et al. 2006), but their virulence in wild bumble bees remains unknown. Nonetheless, the increased use of bumble bees in greenhouse operations in recent decades has been implicated in the decline of members of the subgenus Bombus, including Rusty-patched Bumble Bee, Yellow-banded Bumble Bee and Western Bumble Bee (Thorp and Shepherd 2005; NRC 2007; Evans et al. 2008; COSEWIC 2010; Szabo et al. 2012)",0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,3,3,5,4,"Small scope because there are large areas of natural habitat where the pesticide is not applied; serious severity because of the known impacts of pesticides, and high timing because the practice is continuing.",0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,3,3,5,4,"Occurs within the core of the species range, southern ON, QC and eastern provinces. This is why the threat is scored at > 11%. Around the time when the declines of Bombus s.s. were noted, a new pesticide, Imidacloprid (a neonicotinoid), was registered for use in the US and Canada (1994 and 1995 respectively: Cox 2001; Pest Management Regulatory Agency [PMRA] 2001). Neonicotinoids pose a particular threat to bees (compared to other pesticides) because they are harmful even at concentrations in the parts per billion (ppb) range (Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] 1994; Marletto et al. 2003). These pesticides are systemic and travel throughout the plant, reaching pollen and nectar and are commonly used on golf courses and agricultural lands (Sur and Stork 2003). The effects of Imidacloprid are not lethal to bumble bees when used as directed (e.g., Tasei et al. 2001); however, studies of its effects on bumble bees were only tested on one species, Common Eastern Bumble Bee (B. impatiens), as the representative for all North American species (Gels et al. 2002; Morandin and Winston 2003).

Nectar source requirements for Hoptree Borer are unknown, but females of related species (Yponomeuta malinellus) require nectar feeding for a week or more before they are sexually mature (Carter 1984). The most invasive plants at Point Pelee include White Mulberry (Morus alba), Japanese Knotweed (Polygonum cuspidatum), White Poplar (Populus alba), Spotted Knapweed (Centaurea maculosa), English Ivy (Hedera helix), Garlic Mustard (Alliaria petiolaris), and Orange Daylily (Hemerocallis fulva) (Dougan and Associates 2009). Common Hoptree Threats: prefer disturbed areas which are also generally the best areas for invasive alien species that could impact this species. Uncertain as to degree of impact however (in terms of mortality). In some areas of Point Pelee, there are negative effects on seedling establishment but it is uncertain as to whether this is a proximate activity or limiting factor.",0,0,2,0,4,"Hoptree Borer Threats: Population outbreaks of the Hoptree Leaf-roller Moth (Agonopterix pteleae, Lepidoptera: Elachistidae) can result in nearly complete defoliation of Common Hoptree. It is abundant at Point Pelee (Scarr et al. 2007), and extensive feeding damage was observed on Pelee Island in 2014, where smaller trees were frequently completely defoliated (COSEWIC 2015). The Hoptree Barkbeetle (Phloeotribus scabricollis) can cause twig and shoot dieback. This species was observed on several of the Common Hoptree populations in 2000-2002 (COSEWIC 2002), causing losses of major parts of affected trees, including loss of flowering. Both of these insect herbivores may adversely affect Hoptree Borer populations through direct competition and leaf and shoot dieback. The large colony of Double-crested Cormorants on Middle Island has been identified as a potential threat to Common Hoptree (COSEWIC 2015), but presence of Hoptree Borer there requires confirmation. There are no documented decline in population as a result of threat from cormorants where Common Hoptree seems to be resilient to this threat, therefore threat is accounted for as unknown. Common Hoptree Threats: Main threat is on Middle Island where there is a large population of Double-crested Cormorants. However, as long as the population continues to be managed, at current nesting levels, impacts not high (or of a negative affect). Uncertainty points to more research needed to distinguish affects of Hoptree Borer as limiting factor rather than a threat.

Recovery efforts focus on working with partners and landowners to implement best management practices within watersheds, promoting the maintenance of healthy aquatic ecosystems, and conducting surveys to improve knowledge on the distribution and abundance of the species. The impacts of some potential threats to this species, such as changes in water chemistry due to agricultural run-off, are not well understood because of a lack of knowledge of the species' biology and ecology, including the role of natural and human-made water control structures in providing habitat for Hungerford's Crawling Water Beetle. Addressing such knowledge gaps will be an important part of achieving the population and distribution objectives. Confirmation of the specific habitat requirements of Hungerford's Crawling Water Beetle, including the distribution and role of the larval food plant (i.e., D. tuberosus), water quality and flow requirements, tolerance to sediment loads, habitat for reproduction and hibernation, and dispersal ability may also be important to achieving the population and distribution objectives. Provided that other threats to stream habitat (e.g., reduction of water quality) are managed and mitigated, stable or increasing local populations would be expected to persist within the species' current range.
The recovery goal is to enhance long-term population viability by maintaining at least three self-sustaining populations of Hungerford’s Crawling Water Beetle in Ontario. This should be achieved by actively protecting and managing suitable habitat for this species and its ecosystem in southern Ontario. Protection and recovery objectives are as follows. Protect existing populations and habitat where Hungerford’s Crawling Water Beetle is found; Determine the distribution and abundance of Hungerford’s Crawling Water Beetle outside the existing known sites; Investigate the habitat requirements of the species and in particular determine the role of human-made impoundments; Identify, quantify and seek to mitigate or remove threats to existing populations; Promote ongoing measures to protect vegetation adjacent to the extant occurrences of Hungerford’s Crawling Water Beetle and watershed vegetation cover; Investigate the possibility of translocation from a thriving population to the North Saugeen population, if required;

 In order to apply appropriate conservation measures, it is important to more accurately determine the current population of the Lake Erie Watersnake in Canada. The most recent Canadian surveys took place more than ten years ago, and it is unknown if increased consumption of Round Goby by the subspecies has had the same beneficial effects on the Canadian population as it has for the United States population. Once current population estimates are established, the necessary monitoring protocols can be implemented in order to identify population and distribution trends and address threats as needed. A collaborative, stewardship first approach that partners with the municipality, the provincial and federal governments, and local partners is intended to meet both the needs of the community and species that contribute to Pelee Island's biodiversity, such as Lake Erie Watersnake.

Knowledge gaps relating to the impact, scope, severity and timing of certain threats, including road mortality, and shoreline habitat loss, impacts resulting from changes in island bird populations (i.e., Double-crested Cormorants, and Wild Turkeys) and the potential impact of SFD need to be addressed. The community of Pelee Island celebrates their natural history and significant efforts have been made to address primary threats of habitat loss as well as accidental or intentional mortality, through collaborative conservation efforts and information exchange, and through improved signage and road speed reduction. Continuing efforts that foster community-based conservation initiatives and promote habitat stewardship and threat mitigation remain very important components to protect the biodiversity of the island, including the Lake Erie Watersnake.",0,NA,NA,"Outreach and stewardship, Research and monitoring, Habitat management",NA,0,1,1,NR,NR,NR,NR,1,1,1,1.1,11/5/2015,"Jim Bogart (COSEWIC Amphibians and Reptiles Specialist Subcommittee co-chair), Ruben Boles (Canadian Wildlife Service), Richard King (Northern Illinois University), Patrick Nantel (Parks Canada),Scott Reid (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry), Kristin Standford (Ohio State University Stone Laboratory), Rob Willson (status report author)

Determine extent and abundance of any newly discovered remnant populations detected. Establish stations to monitor changes to Lilliput habitat. This monitoring will inform threat level assessments regarding impacts to populations and will complement and be integrated into routine population surveys. It will also allow for the evaluation of progress achieved through recovery implementation activities to reduce threats. Monitor the distribution and abundance of Zebra Mussel within currently occupied habitats (for example, critical habitat areas). Quantify infestation rates for live mussels that are present and determine upstream limit of Zebra Mussel within Lilliput-bearing systems. Deliver outreach sessions on species at risk mussels, their critical habitat, and the threats facing them. The Hamilton Harbour Remedial Action Plan is a project planned to improve water quality and habitat in the Hamilton Harbour watershed and Cootes Paradise Marsh. Examples of some of the activities that have occurred as part of the plan include Common Carp exclusion from Cootes Paradise, as well as extensive fish and habitat monitoring. The objective of the plan is to clean up Hamilton Harbour and to improve the health of the ecosystem.
Research : Identify thresholds of tolerance to habitat modifications (for example, fluctuations in water levels) to aid in determining what constitutes destruction of Lilliput critical habitat. ,Determine glochidia and juvenile sensitivity to environmental contaminants that populations of Lilliput may be exposed to, particularly those contaminants found in the sediment. Determine the life history of the Lilliput (for example, age at maturation) to inform critical habitat identification and improve modelling efforts designed to determine quantifiable recovery targets. Determine the feasibility of augmenting existing populations of Lilliput where needed, and investigate the feasibility re-establishing Lilliput into historical habitat where appropriate. Develop genetically sound propagation guidelines for freshwater mussels.
stewardship and outreach: Implement local stewardship programs to improve habitat conditions and reduce threats within critical habitat and historical habitats. Priorities and mitigation approaches to be informed through threat evaluation research. Address watershed-scale stressors to Lilliput populations and their habitat in cooperation with existing relevant aquatic ecosystem recovery teams. Increase public awareness of the potential impacts of transporting and releasing invasive species (including baitfish). Encourage public support and participation in mussel recovery by developing awareness materials and programs, which in turn will encourage participation in local stewardship programs to improve and protect Lilliput habitat.

The recovery strategy does not include population and distribution objectives or a recovery planning table and critical habitat cannot be identified at this time. As such, there is no risk for the implementation of this strategy to inadvertently lead to adverse effects on other species.A priority for research is to locate viable population of Macropis Cuckoo Bee in association with Macropis nest sites. Surveys for Lysimachia and Macropis in suitable habitat in Nova Scotia, and the northern Great Plains and adjacent areas (for example, southcentral Canada from western Ontario to Alberta) would be particularly worthwhile.
The Alberta specimen was collected in Elk Island National Park. Elk Island National Park protects a representative portion of the Southern Boreal Plains and Plateaux Natural Region. If Macropis Cuckoo Bee (with associated Macropis ) is confirmed in Elk Island National Park, the National Parks Act will benefit the Macropis Cuckoo Bee, its host bees (Macropis ), and its Lysimachia habitat.

The Nova Scotia Wetland Conservation Policy may provide for the conservation and management of wetlands in Nova Scotia. If Macropis Cuckoo Bees are present in Nova Scotia, the Nova Scotia Wetland Conservation Policy and the promotion of wetland stewardship may benefit the Macropis Cuckoo Bee, its Macropis hosts, and its Lysimachia habitat.

Misty Lake Ecological Reserve was established in 1996 under the Protected Areas of British Columbia Act, with the primary intent of protecting sticklebacks in the lake. The reserve was increased from 55 ha to 68 ha in 2001, which represents the area of the lake itself and a strip of land around it. Misty Lake and short sections of the inlet and outlet streams are contained within the Misty Lake Ecological Reserve (COSEWIC 2006). The entire reserve affords protection from consumptive uses that include hunting, fishing, and camping. Since the creation of the Misty Lake Ecological Reserve, the sticklebacks have been protected from capture or retention within the reserve’s boundaries, except when authorized by permit.

Insufficient information is available about current population abundance to develop scientifically defensible quantitative targets for the Mountain Sucker, Pacific populations. Therefore, the management objective for Mountain Sucker, Pacific populations, is to maintain self-sustaining populations throughout their current distribution to ensure the species’ long-term viability in the wild.

Activities also highlight the need for habitat restoration. Various stakeholders will  need to be engaged including private and public landowners, land users, planners, non-government and government organizations. Partnerships will need to be developed with willing landowners and conservation groups particularly when considering re-introduction on the mainland. Habitat protection, management and restoration are of the utmost importance to recover Northern Bobwhite, as habitat loss and fragmentation have been the most significant threats to the species. On-going implementation of best management practices to control European Common Reed and other invasive plant species will be needed. Assessing habitat for interspersion of key habitat types and ensuring sufficient quantity and connectivity of habitat, particularly of winter habitat, will be required to guide habitat restoration on Walpole Island First Nation and the mainland. Threat mitigation will be necessary to reduce predation and other causes of mortality and encourage population growth of the remaining population on Walpole Island First Nation and eventually, if feasible, a re-introduced population on the mainland. Outreach and education will be needed to reduce exposure to herbicides and insecticides and encourage ecologically appropriate use of fire on Walpole Island First Nation. Further restriction of game bird hunting preserves on the mainland will need to be considered as locations for habitat restoration and re-introduction are identified and prioritized. Collaboration with agencies and organizations involved in Northern Bobwhite research in the United States will be important to use lessons-learned  from the extensive amount of work completed and underway south of the border. Where technically feasible, further genetic analysis in the form of a monitoring program could provide more insight into the genetic diversity of Northern Bobwhites on Walpole Island First Nation and if necessary birds on the mainland, and also help understand future patterns of population expansion, dispersal behaviour, habitat use and identification of potential sink habitats (Miller et al. 1999; Frankham et al. 2002 in Chabot 2014). It could also help evaluate the need for and scope of a captive breeding and release program, if deemed appropriate and feasible.

These objectives are broad at this time because the recovery team lacks basic information on the amount of suitable habitat available historically, relative to current supply and predicted future supplies (under different management scenarios), as well as population responses to habitat supply over time. Therefore, the recovery team has outlined a number of activities and associated timelines, which will help close these information gaps at which time the recovery objectives can be refined and updated.

2.4 Approaches to meeting recovery objectives: The approaches to recovery have been organized into four broad strategies: research and monitoring (table 2), management (table 3), stewardship (table 4), and awareness (table 5). Successful recovery will require consideration of approaches from all categories. A narrative has been included after each table where appropriate. Recovery of these five species cannot be achieved through the actions of any one party. Implementation of the recovery approaches outlined below will require a concerted effort of many groups including, but not limited to, federal, provincial and municipal governments, conservation authorities, academic institutions, Indigenous communities, non-governmental organizations, and local citizens.

Broad strategies to recover Offshore Killer Whale:
monitor the population abundance and demographics of Offshore Killer Whales and refine knowledge of their use of Canadian Pacific waters
ensure that Offshore Killer Whales have an adequate and accessible food supply to allow recovery
ensure that disturbance from human activities does not prevent the recovery of Offshore Killer Whales
ensure that chemical and biological pollutants do not prevent the recovery of Offshore Killer Whale populations
identify critical habitat for designation and protection
The general approaches to support these broad strategies are identified in Table 2. The majority of approaches are to meet the need for foundational knowledge about the Offshore Killer Whale population. Additional approaches support the need to further understand and mitigate the identified anthropogenic and natural threats.

Jan 2016 NOTES START HERE: there is no housing or cottage development unless its in the military housing. Victoria - Dune Point sanddunes and Burstall - thre is some houses but they've been there a long time, if there is new development not likely, but there are houses or barns on the sites, particularly at Burnstall - quarters are divided into numerous landowners.",1,1,1,1,3,"CFB Dundurn and CFB Wainwright may be developed for military housing, although unlikely to be large in scope. There is no cottage development nearby most of these sites - the habitat is not higly favoured for urban housing or other development. The likelihood of development occuring is very low. Jan 2016 NOTES START HERE: one of the bases may be getting further development - there may be some expansion, building infrastructure such as containment for storing materials (Diana).",1,1,1,1,3,"CFB Dundurn and CFB Wainwright are not zoned for recreational development. At Spruce Woods Provincial Park, there is a hiking trail through the dunes but there is not likely to be development; trail expansion and maintenance may increase the footprint of the trail although this is not currently planned and would likely be negligible. CFB Shilo is adjacent to the park, and although the moth is not recorded from this property, there is no recreational development permitted. Jan 2016 NOTES START HERE: expansion of areas (footprint) in the areas - is this likely? There are existing hiking trails at some sites, is there potential for future development? Diana - not formalized recreational area - there are ATV designated areas, there is informal casual use but no planned expansion (this will be captured under 6.1 recreational areas).",1,NA,2.5,2.5,3,4,NA,1,2.5,2.5,3,4,"Applicable. Conversion to crop or forage is not likely: dune habitat is not considered to be of high crop productivity. Surrounding habitat is also not of high forage production quality. NOTES START HERE: Diana - potato farming in sandy areas has been an issue, there has been some lobbying against it in Southern AB (Victoria does not know about this); Victoria - most of the dune complex itself was allocated to ranching, but there were areas with sandy soils south of dunes that were cultivated. If it doesn't always require active dune systems (like Dusky dune moth) it could be a larger threat with Pale Yellow ebcause there is cultivation occuring outside of these active areas. Diana - farmers are irrigating very much, raising water table, and in southern MB too. Need to look further into potato farming, but also haying in areas and irrigating areas for hay. Marginal habitat is being developmed. There was pushback from the conservation community in southern AB (need to check into this) and the potato farming was likely stalled or stopped. Diana - PYDM was found in a stubble field, so there is a possibility of it being in some fields - if it's hay, it may not be as bad as potato farming.",1,-2,NA,NA,1,"NA. Historically wood plantations were planted within some dune habitats to provide windbreaks for areas prone to severe wind erosion particularly during dry periods. They were not planted directly within occupied moth habitat. However, they may unintentionally provide wind shelter that would promote encroachment and stabilization and thereby indirectly affect open sand dune habitat further downwind. NOTES START HERE: Diana - yes this is correct in terms of a historical threat.",0,0,3.5,0,4,"Cattle grazing was cited as a threat in the first status report (COSEWIC 2007). Cattle may enable the sparsely vegetated open sand habitats to remain open yet may increase soil compaction. Livestock farming or ranching occurs within some of the extant sites, although in others (Spruce Woods Provincial Park) there is no livestock grazing. Lack of grazing by native bison. Jan 2016 NOTES START HERE: Cattle grazing was cited as a threat, cattle may enable sparsely vegetated open habitats to remain open, and yet heavy overgrazing may have an adverse impact. Rob - this is one of those situations where human activity can be useful and detrimental. Does anyone know how susceptible these larvae are to trampling or disturbance. Bison/cattle create new habitat, but what are their impacts on the moth itself? Diana - one reference, during a drought with heavy cattle grazing there was some sand exposure - look at Wolfe reference. Need to make sure the threat is properly described and written - it's very complex threat and whether it is a threat or not and the unknowns. Need to make the link to historical bison grazing. In the Managemetn Plan - we didn't mention cattle grazing as a threat, it was lumped in with the alteration with grazing/cumulative effects.",0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA.,1,NA,-1,3,-1,3,NA,1,-1,3,-1,3,"Potentially applicable at some sites and within potential unsurveyed small sand habitats. NOTES START HERE: Diana - shallow gas drilling occurs in Great Sand Hills but PYDM hasn't been found here yes. But there is potential for development. Diana - pipelines for sure are ongoing, but these aren't in this category. In SK there has been extensive drilling in the past few years. Victoria - Burstall no drilling, but Dune Point there is some drilling. Potential in sandy habitats. We don't really know if this is ongoing in the immediate vicinity of PYDM sites. government is promoting government (SW SK and SE SK) so there is desire and potential for develoment. Diana - the Aweme site, Chris Schmidt - this is where Criddle and another collector, this is where they likely lived - Aweme is probably refering to Spruce Woods Provincial Park. Aweme is southern MB - we have no way of knowing where the collection is from. Victoria - for this threat, almost leaning towards unknown? It could be up to all of the sites in the next ten years, except for the military bases (so up to 7 of the sites). Severity - within the scope, the severity is likely to be slight-moderate - or unknown? Victoria - we don't know what the impacts would be on the species? Paul - the footprint would likely be small, for the infrastructure development and road maintenance and access. Diana - with shallow-gas drililng the water table changes - is the water table going to be lower (may create potential better habitat becasue drier soils are created) or other affects. The affects on water tables for irrigation and gas wells.",1,-1,2,-1,4,"Potentially applicable at some sites and within potential unsurveyed small sand habitats. Jan 2016 NOTES START HERE: Is there any gravel extraction? Sand extraction? Diana - there is one site in southern AB (Caukey Lake), has potential sand or gravel extraction and this is ongoing and expected to continue in the future. Many of the sites are privately owned, and sand/gravel could occur by a private landowner at any time. We could go towards a small scope, which could reflect the possibility of it occuring elsewhere. In the area where the sand is extracted, there is a threat, but if it's not the entire habitat it's not likely to be affected. Victoria and Diana - will follow up to estimate size of gravel pit and estimate the size of the impact?",0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA. The probability of solar energy or wind turbine construction within the area is unlikely. Jan 2016 NOTES START HERE: Diana - not to my knowledge.,1,NA,1,1,2,4,"We didn't chose the Extreme severity for Roads/Railraods because this is refering to mortality, and this isn't accurate for the roll-up, so we chose slight.",1,1,1,5,4,"Applicable. Jan 2016 NOTES START HERE: Victoria - not likely to have too many new roads, people do drive throughout their property all the time. There may be some road mortality, and moths could certainly be hit or crushed from traffic. Diana - one collection was at a fire guard. PYDM are often found in banks that have been cut away from roadways, and fire guards, these exposed spots. For mortality from roadkills - military bases there is ongoing traffic, but we don't really know what's ongoing on miliatry bases. In the prairies people drive randomly, and don't always follow roads. We selected Extreme to reflect the road mortality.",1,1,1,2,4,"Applicable. Jan 2016 NOTES START HERE: Diana - pipelines for gas associated with shallow gas wells in sand hills. Pipelines are a greater threat than roads. A lot of the oil and gas lines are above ground, and they aren't underground until they are in urban environments. In remote settings they are aboveground. The drilling involved, they are set up on joints. There is initial disturbance when the pipeline is installed, but afterwards they may not be present. The gas lines are installed underground. The underground ones aren't deep. It depends on the jurisdication as to what is required after a pipeline is installed. There is ongoing maintenance too. It's the disturbance and then the maintenance. If you can imagine, on a quarter section (160acres) you may have 4 - 8 gas wells. Victoria - it depends, you can have many. This is variable, but in some cases there can be many. At Burstall, we didn't see many in the immediate vicinity, but at the other site the wells are numerous. As an indication of density, there may be up to 32 wells on a section? Victoria - 4 -5 at a quarter section. Diana - have these roads that connect all the wells, it's a spider web, and these roads need to be maintained and connected. The problem is we don't know the sites or where the species occurs. The intensity of the wells in some places (pipelines) is high, and in other areas it's not. Diana - it's fairly high density, Burstall has a processing plant right there. Pipelines have to test them, run high pressure water through the well and then spray the water on the land. Paul - these are part of the oil and gas drilling itself. Diana - the pressure hot water is ran through and sprayed to the surrounding habitats. Victoria - we should be clear that the maintenance is the threat to this and scored here - the flushing of the water and the access to these areas and testing and checking the pipelines.",0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA.,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA.,1,NA,1,1,5,3,NA,1,1,1,5,3,"Cited as a potential threat in the COSEWIC (2007) report and Management Plan (Environment Canada) but overall negligible. Jan 2016 NOTES START HERE: Victoria - agree that it's a negligible scope. Although when individuals are captured, they are likely to die, it's not a common occurrence. Trapping at CWS is live trapping (haven't caught many though). Many people that do trapping use killing agents. There is the possiblity of incidental collection. Rob suggested talking to Chris Schmidt on this question? Adjust the severity accordingly. Overall, this threat is considered minimal.",0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA.,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA.,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA.,1,NA,2,5,2,4,NA,1,2,5,2,4,"Applicable. Recreational activities such as hiking, dog-walking and potential ATV use in sites not within parks or military bases. These places are not high density with recreation, except perhaps Spruce Woods. The physial area (footprint) of the recreation will small.",1,2,3,2,4,"Applicable at two sites, CFB Dundurn and CFB Wainright; also potentiall applicable at unsurveyed habitat in CFB Shilo, which is adjacent to Spruce Woods Provincial Park. Shilo is not well-surveyed because of unexploded ordinances. Jan 2016 NOTES START HERE: heavy vehicle use, ground manoeuvers, trucks, within this scope, is moderate severity suitable? We selected unknown because we don't really know what goes on in these areas. Diana - did go on their website to see what they do there. They have infantry, unexploded ordinances, etc. Jessica - has anyone tried contacting the base and asked them? She asked one of the military bases to do Mottled Duskywing, and they were very helpful with answering questions and what was going on. Paul - yes some of the military bases have onsite biologists, it's about trying to define and survey damage and how much of an impact it's having on the species. This may be worth following up. Most of the time though, this information is confidetial. Victoria - for Shilo, can get a map and they've planned out the area. The military activities are restricted even for the military. Victoria can try and look this up. We were doing it for a SARA permit a while ago, and she came across a map. Unknown for Dundurn or Wainwright.",1,2,4,2,3,"Research activities other than moth trapping (accounted for under Hunting and Collecting), from vegetation monitoring to climate change monitoring are ongoing. Any permitting for these research activities include provisions to protect the moth. There is the possibility of mortality from over the over-collection while completing surveys for other moths and/or incidental mortality from by-catch related to the trapping and collecting of other moth species related to scientific research. Spruce Woods Provincial Park, CFB Wainwright, CFB Dundurn and Suffern Lake Regional Park requires permits, which stipulate capture techniques and limit moths collected. Jan 2016 NOTES START HERE: there are research activites at these dune sites. Possibilty from overcollection when completing surveyes from other moths. Most require permits. Follow up and ask Chris Schmidt about this. Victoria - for CWS surveys, they weren't using the killing agent, but even when targeting other species, Pale Yellow could be collected. There was bycatch mortality of other moth species though. There may be other studies ongoing too. Victoria - only site she knows is at Suffield at National Wildlfie Area - doing trials there, but with little success, to try to bring about some destabilization. Ask Chris Schmidt about these sites.",1,NA,2.5,5,2.5,3,NA,1,-1,5,-1,4,"Applicable. Cited in the WFM recovery strategy as likely exacerbating vegetation encroachment and dune stabilization. Wildfires are not part of the natural dune processes, however wildfires from artillary fire within encroaching vegetation is a possibilty. These wildfires are not necessarily extinguished unless they are a threat to military base itself. There is a fire guard around CFB Shilo to ensure artillary fires do not spread outside the base. NOTES START HERE: fire is a natural process? There could be some direct mortality from fires, and this is a threat, but indirectly fire opens up and maintains some of the habitats. Diana - there is a lot of discussion on fire history and fire suppression. Now (in the future) we will likely get grass fires. Victoria - in the management plan, under alteration of natural regime, grasslands burn every 4 - 10 years prior to European settlement. Noting that this species occurs in the more stabilized portions of the dunes (more grassy areas). Diana - some of our sites, it's awkward for some of these areas.",0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA.,1,2.5,5,2.5,3,"There is a proposed pilot study to determine if dune reactivation restoration is a viable option and should proceed. This project would include provisions for the protection of the moth during restoration actvities. The methods used for dune reactivation restoration may include pesticide application or other applications. Jan 2016 NOTES START HERE: Lack of natural disturbance. The lack of bison is a historical threat. The natural succesion of these habitats is ongoing. Diana - there has been two studies, 94% decline in exposes sand since the early 1900s. I think there is enough information and papers on this. Look up the Wolfe papers and whether we can draw something from this. The only site that it's been found in the last ten years has been Spruce Woods. Lafontaine suggests there are a broad range of habitats. Victoria - Wolfe went back and one of the dunes near Burstall was completely stabilized. But we really dont' know the habitat, it could be in some of these partially stabilized habitats, so it could be still there. Combined with the low population and abundance and lack of detection, it's hard to know what the severity is?",1,NA,-1,5,-1,4,NA,1,-1,5,-1,4,"Invasive plant species are present in the habitat and surrounding area. They are currently established but sproadic. Based on these observations it is thought that they will persist and expand but at a relatively slower rate than when compared to sand mixed grass prairie adjacent to the dune habitat. Invasive plant spread is not considered a high threat because the plants just don't grow or establish quickly unless there is preceeding encroachment of the other species. They are in low-lying areas, Leafy Spurge, but overall this isn't a threat. Invasive non-native plants occur in clusters. Jan 2016 NOTES START HERE: Not scored because it's counted in 7.3. But this is mentioned here. We don't know the host plant for PYDM, so we don't really know how invasive plants affect the species. Baby's breath and Crested Wheat-grass are also invasvie plants. These moths tend to be generalists, and we don't know if they potentially consume the invasive plants in these areas, so we don't know whether host plant consumption is a threat. Invasive species would contribute to 7.3 Other Ecosystems modifications. START AGAIN: Diane - we are limited in our knowledge of invasive species",1,-1,5,-1,4,"Dune stabilization due to native plant encroachment. This is due to the continuation of a natural relatively wetter climatic regime. This is projected to continue within the coming decades. Serious severity since evidence WFM habitat can be some degree of slightly vegetated habitat. Growth of trees into the dune stabilization. The problematic native species are due to the climate, because it's wetter and warmer, this is why it's encroaching in the first place. These processes are being driven by the climate.

Jan 2016 NOTES START HERE: there is some potato and agricultural farming. This is where we incorporate some of the pollutants from these activities. Diana - definitely have livestock and are fertilizing the soil, and increase vegetaion growth in these nutrient soils. Definitely pesticide drift and use. Diana - we are finding glycosophate in water bodies on the prairies, this is part of the agricultural portions. Paul - is this in terms of well water.

It may not be flooding, it's the soil is saturated with water and the water table has increased and it floods burrows (with, for example, Burrowing Owls), and the increased water in the water table floods things.

The scores reflect information in status report, teleconference discussions, modelling predictions, as well as literature on body condition, productivity, survival, etc. related to sea-ice. Assumptions used in various models results in ranges of uncertainty in their predictions of actual population level response. There was agreement that significant negative effects of climate change on sea-ice are expected, although there is unlikely to be a linear relationship between population levels and sea-ice, with a range of consequences and impacts. The recent model by IUCN (Wiig et al. 2015) was discussed, which presents three approaches to analyze relationships between Polar Bear demography and the extent/duration of sea-ice cover. As the best long-term data sets for the global model come from Canadian management units, the global IUCN conclusions are broadly representative of the Canadian situation, although Canada has a wide range of sea conditions. However, the units in Canada with the most data are also the most southerly ones, which are units likely to be impacted to the greatest extent by sea-ice change. Note that over a 30-year window, some areas may have a period of improved habitat (with better access to prey), though this is debated because Ringed Seal are long-lived species and it may take years for populations in low density areas on multi-year ice environments to increase to stable levels on thinner ice.

Conduct targeted surveys of extant populations using sampling techniques proven effective at detecting Pugnose Minnow to quantify distribution and abundance of extant populations. Conduct targeted surveys within the historical range of Pugnose Minnow where the species is thought to be extirpated. Determine extent and abundance of any new populations detected. Conduct targeted surveys in non-historical areas for undetected populations in areas with suitable habitat characteristics. 
Research: Develop a standardized index population and habitat monitoring program with a specific sampling protocol. Determine the life history of the Pugnose Minnow to inform critical habitat identification and improve modelling efforts designed to determine quantifiable recovery targets. Investigate potential threats such as sources of contamination and toxic substances (for example, manure spills). Identify thresholds of tolerance to habitat modifications (for example, loss of aquatic macrophytes and riparian vegetation) to determine what constitutes destruction of critical habitat. Determine the feasibility of augmenting existing populations of Pugnose Minnow where needed, and investigate the feasibility of re-establishing Pugnose Minnow in historical habitat where appropriate.
Management and coordination : Work with municipal planning authorities so that they consider the protection of critical habitat for Pugnose Minnow within official plans. Work with relevant organizations (for example, conservation authorities, OMNRF, First Nations) to share knowledge, combine resources, implement recovery actions and ensure a coordinated approach to recovery. Promote stewardship Best Management Practices (BMPs) among landowners and First Nations abutting aquatic habitats of Pugnose Minnow, and other local landowners with potential to have direct or indirect effects on the habitat of Pugnose Minnow. Conservation authorities (Essex Region, Lower Thames Valley, Upper Thames River, and St. Clair Region) continue to play a vital role in stewardship and public education programs, which have resulted in increased awareness of species at risk and improvements to habitat and water quality throughout the range of Pugnose Minnow in Ontario. For example, the SCRCA offers grants to landowners to improve agricultural practices, tree planting and other general stewardship activities that provide direct benefits to species at risk in the Sydenham River watershed.
Stewardship and outreach : Support invasive species awareness initiatives for the public.

It is important to ensure adequate protection of habitat and water quality for the species' survival and recovery. The locations where the species has been found in the Credit, Thames, Humber and Mississippi Rivers should all be prescribed as habitat in a habitat regulation. At each location, the area prescribed as habitat should include the section of the river containing the rapids and the pools below the rapids, plus the wooded shores on either side extending inland to include any forest which is within 800 metres of the shoreline.
No specific recovery efforts for the Rapids Clubtail have been reported to date. However, ongoing work by conservation authorities and municipalities across the province to improve and maintain water quality/quantity will help to protect the habitat needed by this species and will be integral to any natural or assisted recovery. Such projects include water quality/quantity sampling and monitoring, shoreline protection and erosion prevention, benthos sampling and monitoring and landowner stewardship programs. Legislation to restrict cosmetic pesticide use in Ontario may also improve the situation for the Rapids Clubtail and other insects.

2.4 Approaches to meeting recovery objectives: The approaches to recovery have been organized into four broad strategies: research and monitoring (table 2), management (table 3), stewardship (table 4), and awareness (table 5). Successful recovery will require consideration of approaches from all categories. A narrative has been included after each table where appropriate. Recovery of these five species cannot be achieved through the actions of any one party. Implementation of the recovery approaches outlined below will require a concerted effort of many groups including, but not limited to, federal, provincial and municipal governments, conservation authorities, academic institutions, Indigenous communities, non-governmental organizations, and local citizens.

2.4 Approaches to meeting recovery objectives: The approaches to recovery have been organized into four broad strategies: research and monitoring (table 2), management (table 3), stewardship (table 4), and awareness (table 5). Successful recovery will require consideration of approaches from all categories. A narrative has been included after each table where appropriate. Recovery of these five species cannot be achieved through the actions of any one party. Implementation of the recovery approaches outlined below will require a concerted effort of many groups including, but not limited to, federal, provincial and municipal governments, conservation authorities, academic institutions, Indigenous communities, non-governmental organizations, and local citizens.

Successful recovery will require consideration of approaches from all categories. A narrative has been included after each table where appropriate. Recovery of these five species cannot be achieved through the actions of any one party. Implementation of the recovery approaches outlined below will require a concerted effort of many groups including, but not limited to, federal, provincial and municipal governments, conservation authorities, academic institutions, Indigenous communities, non-governmental organizations, and local citizens.

Plants have not been seen in two of the three Windsor sub-populations (i.e., Black Oak Heritage Park and Tallgrass Prairie Heritage Park sub-populations) over the last two decades, which is likely due to habitat degradation. Thus, maintaining the existing population for the foreseeable future may require on-going restoration (Jones 2013). This will include significant habitat management and restoration efforts, as well as invasive species control. Appropriate actions for each of the three sub-populations are being initiated (Jones pers. comm. 2015). Even with active, ambitious, and dedicated habitat management and restoration activities, the long-term sustainability of this small population of only 165 plants is not known. Determining the population viability over the long-term is identified as a research need within the provincial recovery strategy (Jones 2013) and the Slender Bush-clover – Ontario Government Response Statement (Part 3). In addition, Environment and Climate Change Canada recognizes the role of cultivating and maintaining specimens at off-site locations for the purpose of supporting research on the feasibility and appropriateness of introducing or reintroducing the Slender Bush-clover at sites in Ojibway Park, Tallgrass Prairie Heritage Park and Black Oak Heritage Park (government-supported action #3 - Part 3). Reintroduction may play an important role in the recovery of the species where habitat is considered suitable and in improving the viability of the extant population. 
As a precaution, it would be beneficial to establish some plantings of Slender Bush-clover in locations separate from the current patch to ensure that the species is not extirpated in case of an accidental event, such as a storm. The few plants in the garden bed at the Ojibway Nature Centre could be augmented to ensure a stable garden population. Slender Bush-clover is listed on Schedule 1 of the ESA as endangered only within Olibway Park, Black Oak Heritage Park and Tallgrass Heritage Park, so the plants would not have legal protection elsewhere. Therefore, it might be advisable to establish an additional restoration population somewhere within one of these parks to ensure the plants would be protected. Relocation of the restoration sites where the species was planted in Lambton County would also be beneficial to see if any restored populations of Slender Bush-clover have survived.

2. To assess and mitigate the extent of the main threats (tourism and recreation development, dams and water management/use, invasive non-native species) to the three populations in B.C: investigate the impacts of invasive species and vegetation succession; potential lakeshore development, both commercial and recreational, must be monitored with respect to small-flowered lipocarpha occurrences and habitat.
3. To confirm the distribution of small-flowered lipocarpha in B.C. (existing and new locations), and update recovery objectives as needed: determine physical habitat attributes of known sites ; revisit known sites during low water level years to determine number of occupied sites, number of plants and area of occupancy; investigate natural hydrologic processes necessary to maintain populations.

The strategy describes protection and recovery objectives for this species in Ontario, including to:
•	protect and maintain the quality and quantity of habitat on Pelee Island where the Small-mouthed Salamander occurs
•	implement a monitoring program for salamander populations, habitats, and threats on Pelee Island including surveys of suitable habitat
•	promote and carry out research on Small-mouthed Salamander genetics, populations and threats
•	investigate existing, former, and potential Small-mouthed Salamander habitats on Pelee Island to determine if restoration, re-introduction or population interventions would be appropriate; and
•	implement education, stewardship and communication programs for private landowners, residents and visitors on Pelee Island
•	 The natural expansion of the existing population to different areas of Pelee Island may be encouraged through the stewardship and management of potential recovery habitat (not currently occupied by the salamander). Approaches to recovery will focus on working in collaboration with the municipality, provincial government and local community to monitor current populations, manage current habitat effectively, increase the amount of suitable habitat available for the species, and increase our knowledge of potential threats to the species. Engaging landowners, residents and visitors in habitat management and conservation will continue to be an important part of recovery for the Small-mouthed Salamander and its habitat in Canada. exploring the potential benefits and need for a cost effective head-starting protocol/program (e.g., reproductive monitoring, artificial incubation of eggs, and release of juveniles)

2.4 Approaches to meeting recovery objectives: The approaches to recovery have been organized into four broad strategies: research and monitoring (table 2), management (table 3), stewardship (table 4), and awareness (table 5). Successful recovery will require consideration of approaches from all categories. A narrative has been included after each table where appropriate. Recovery of these five species cannot be achieved through the actions of any one party. Implementation of the recovery approaches outlined below will require a concerted effort of many groups including, but not limited to, federal, provincial and municipal governments, conservation authorities, academic institutions, Indigenous communities, non-governmental organizations, and local citizens.

Various habitat restoration, threat mitigation, and other conservation initiatives have been undertaken in Ontario to benefit the Spiny Softshell. For example, the Upper Thames River Conservation Authority has carried out extensive recovery and stewardship work for the Spiny Softshell, including locating and protecting nests. The Ontario Turtle Trauma Centre (OTTC) in Peterborough rehabilitates wild turtles that were injured in the hopes of recovering and releasing them. Through annual nesting surveys, a total of 59 nests have been located to date, which have been protected through relocation and predation mitigation measures (e.g., fencing) (Galois et al. 2010, 2011, 2012). To increase the nesting success in Quebec, a project of artificial egg incubation, followed by the release of hatchlings, has been implemented by the Implementation Team for the Recovery of Spiny Softshell in 2009

The broad strategies are: Use legislative and administrative tools to conserve Spotted Turtle individuals and habitat; Reduce individual mortality, injury, and illegal collection across the range of the Spotted Turtle in Canada; Protect, manage, and restore habitat across the range of Spotted Turtle in Canada; Improve recruitment in locations where local Spotted Turtle populations are in decline or viability is deemed compromised; Conduct communication, outreach, and stewardship activities; Survey and monitor local Spotted Turtle populations, habitat, and threats; and Conduct research on population demographics, habitat characterization and use, and threats/threat mitigation to fill knowledge gaps. (Implement and evaluate techniques to control predator populations or restrain access to nesting habitats through direct and indirect measures (e.g., garbage removal, predator management, and fencing). Develop a cost effective head starting protocol/program. This would incorporate nest monitoring, artificial incubation of eggs, and release of juveniles.)
At the national scale, the Canadian Herpetological Society (CHS) is the main non-profit organization devoted to the conservation of amphibians and reptiles, including turtles, and conducts the following activities: scientific investigations, public education programs and community projects, compilation and analysis of historical data and the undertaking of projects that support conservation or habitat restoration. In addition to public outreach and conservation initiatives, the Ontario Turtle Trauma Centre (OTTC) in Peterborough, Ontario rehabilitates wild turtles that were injured in the hopes of recovering and releasing them. The centre has admitted over 800 turtles (as of 2013) (Ontario Turtle Trauma Centre 2018).

identify and mitigate impacts of human activity
increase resource user knowledge and raise public awareness of wolffish species through education and communication
promote stewardship initiatives
consult and cooperate with harvesters, processors, scientists, regulators, enforcement, observers, dockside monitors, governments, Indigenous groups and other ocean users
monitor wolffish spatial and temporal abundance patterns
monitor spatial and temporal patterns of natural and human induced mortality

The captive rearing program is under the sole responsibility of the Quebec government. Given the technical difficulties the program has faced in achieving these objectives and the considerable evidence of successful natural reproduction, the program will be reviewed in the very near future to determine whether these efforts should continue. 
Broad strategy 2: research (research on habitat components and environmental conditions, population research). Broad strategy 3: management and coordination (fishery management, habitat management). since 2014, all fishing has been banned in some aggregation sites during the spawning period under the Quebec Fishery Regulations (1990), SOR/90-214, (e.g. the mouth of the Rivière du Sud [periodic ban] and the mouth of the Rivière-Ouelle [year-round ban]). These measures can be reassessed as needed along the St. Lawrence River, upstream from Forestville (on the north shore) and Rimouski (on the south shore), all Striped Bass caught incidentally by commercial or recreational fishers must be released, with the exception of certain specimens caught by fishers with wildlife management licences participating in the monitoring network; instead, they submit their catches to the Government of Quebec for monitoring purposes (DFO 2010). When releasing live fish, fishers must take care to cause the least harm possible (Quebec Fishery Regulations [1990], SOR/90-214, pursuant to the Fisheries Act)

Roads also increase access to the sites, which may enable other threats such as invasive species (scored in section 8.1 below), plant harvesting, trails, camping, mud bogging, etc. On Elk Mountain, a newly constructed road has potentially impacted that population both from direct and indirect increase in access.

To date, at least two B.C. subpopulations have been lost due to clearcutting. Logging activities may include edge effects that alter environmental conditions such as growing conditions, light, and moisture into the forest adjacent to the road making the habitat less suitable. Logging is a threat at several sites. Seven Wildlife Habitat Areas (WHAs) were approved for Tall Bugbane in 2007, with general wildlife measures that afford some level of mitigation for the threat of logging. However, since 2007, 80% of the known occurrences of Tall Bugbane have been discovered outside the existing WHAs and may be susceptible to the threat of logging until additional WHAs that prevent or moderate this activity are approved. Both illegal and legal removal of large individual trees of Bigleaf Maple affects Tall Bugbane due to the ecological changes that occur. For instance, significant loss of canopy cover and changes in site hydrology and soil structure will reduce the suitability of the site for Tall Bugbane. The frequency of this threat is increasing with removal of Bigleaf Maple both with and without permits in the Chilliwack Valley. Over the short term, logging is not perceived to be a serious threat to this species, although this will be a long-term threat to subpopulations not protected by WHAs. Many subpopulations disappear after logging and some return; could depend on whether the site is replanted immediately which provides some shade for Tall Bugbane; if there is a lag in replanting, shrubs will increase and decrease available habitat for re-establishment for Tall Bugbane.

Kaye (2000) mentions fire suppression as a potential threat to this species, as this species may require a fire regime to reach maximum densities, a response to reduced competition, increased light, and a nutrient flush. Additionally, fire suppression could result in high fuel loading resulting in more intense fires. This may in turn kill seeds and rhizomes that might be able to resist mild surface fires. Alverson (1986) and Wentworth (1994) describe the presence of several populations of Tall Bugbane at U.S. sites where fires are known to occur and plant population numbers are high, indicating some degree of fire tolerance. However in B.C., the CWHdm subzone has a “natural disturbance type 2 (NDT2),” characterized by large-scale, catastrophic fires (average 5–50 ha) with a return interval averaging 150–350 years (B.C. Ministry of Forests 1995). In the Chilliwack River Valley, a severe fire was documented for the area in 1938 (Chilliwack Forest District 2003). Populations in this area have persisted despite these intense low frequency fires but the degree of fire resistance is still not quantified and the role of the fire cycle in sustaining healthy viable subpopulations is unknown. Any fires in this area would likely be fought right away (fires definitely could occur if the summers continue to be dry), and roads could be built for fire fighting purposes. However, there is no prescribed burning in the area.",0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,2,2,3,4,"Roadside maintenance activities pose a threat to at least one known subpopulation of Tall Bugbane on Elk Mountain and likely other subpopulations on Vedder Mountain and Mount Thom.

For example, the invasive species Small Touch-me-not (Impatiens parviflora) has been documented at several Tall Bugbane sites. Other fast-growing opportunistic species such as Himalayan Blackberry (Rubus armeniacus) may outcompete and shade Tall Bugbane. Mayberry (2008) also found Wall Lettuce (Mycelis muralis) and Robert’s Geranium (Geranium robertianum), which may act as competitors preventing expansion or re-establishment of Tall Bugbane.

Broadleaved stands at Vedder Mountain have greater herbivory and higher reproduction, but also higher mortality and notably smaller leaves compared to the coniferous stand at Elk Mountain. This suggests that the plants may be stressed due to herbivory. As a result of habitat modifications in the Chilliwack area herbivore numbers are increasing. Herbivores reported for Tall Bugbane include Deer, Roosevelt Elk, and Mountain Beaver (Kaye and Cramer 2002). In studies in the U.S., Kaye (2000, 2001a,b,c, 2002) reports high levels of herbivory for some subpopulations, although herbivory levels fluctuate from year to year. Kaye (1999) also concludes that herbivory by deer and Roosevelt Elk is more frequent in clearcuts and edges than in unmanaged old-growth forests. Recent indications are that herbivory by deer is quite low due to increased hunting the past few years. Native plant competition after logging is a concern -- depends on how site is treated after logging and would need to consider the seral stage of logged sites. Deer may eat seeds/plants but hunting pressure is high and not many deer particularly on Vedder mountain.",0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,2,2,4,4,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,2,2,4,4,"Spray drift from herbicide treatment is a direct threat because the species is susceptible to herbicide and can cause direct mortality.

Herbicides used for road maintenance, agriculture, invasive species management, and silviculture are a concern at several other sites in particular subpopulations on Vedder Mountain.

Road cuts and clearing for helicopter landing pads (Elk Mtn), and clearcut logging (Upper Tamihi, Chipmunk Ck., and historical Cheam Peak & Liumchen Mtn), particularly on steeper slopes, can increase the risk of slides, slumps, or erosion (especially over time). Slides or slumps can change the soil structure and habitat suitability for Tall Bugbane.

In contrast, over a 10 year time scale, collection of marmots for captive breeding will have a positive effect on the population because captive born marmots are released back into the wild. Over the last 20 years (1997 - 2016) 61 marmots have been collected for the breeding program and 490 marmots from the captive population have been released into the wild (7; approximately eight marmots released for every marmot collected).",0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,-1,2,-1,3,"At several colonies, marmot hibernacula have been associated with forested habitat (8), so the loss of trees may have a negative effect. Other than at Mount Washington, however, the trees are at high elevation and small, and therefore unlikely to be logged. Some of the land on Mt. Washington is privately owned, and marmots have occupied hibernacula on this forested land for over a decade. The landowner has wanted to harvest this area for approximately 15 years but has chosen not to because of the potential impact on the marmots. If logging occurred in this part of Mount Washington, it is unknown how the marmots that use the hibernacula within this forested habitat would respond. They may die overwinter (a small negative impact), they may move to another site, or may not be affected. If there is a negative effect, it is unknown if it would affect only the marmots currently residing there or if marmots in the future would also use these hibernacula and be negatively impacted. Recently logged habitats may also negatively affect the population if dispersers settle and create colonies in these habitats. Recently logged areas may provide ""good"" marmot habitat temporarily, but it is ephemeral habitat that decreases in quality as trees start to regrow and close in.",0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,0,5,0,4,NA,0,0,4,0,4,"Marmots live on ski hills, near mountain biking trails, and in alpine areas popular for hiking. These activities appear to have few negative effects, although there is always a small risk that a marmot could be hit by a mountain bike or a dog accompanying a hiker could kill a marmot or transmit a disease. Humans recreating near marmot colonies probably benefit marmots because marmot predators may avoid areas of high human use (9).",0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,5,0,4,There are two groups of workers that would frequent marmot colonies - marmot researchers and employees of the Mount Washington ski resort. The presence of workers near marmot colonies probably benefit marmots because marmot predators may avoid areas of high human use.,1,NA,3,4,3,4,NA,1,-1,2,-1,3,"Mount Washington is at lower elevation and the marmots live in open areas (ski trails) surrounded by trees. At this site, fire suppression could have a negative impact by preventing the benefits of fire (e.g., forest clearing).",1,2,3,2,4,"A new water reservoir is planned for Mount Washington (6). With sufficient funding, any marmots that would be directly affected by the flooding of burrows could be moved. In the past, two marmots drowned (along with several other species) in a reservoir because the lining material was slippery and the marmots could not climb out. Steps have been taken to ensure this cannot happen again (6). The reservoir could be designed and constructed to ensure that marmots could escape if they entered the reservoir, thus, reducing the risk greatly. Buttle Lake's water level is controlled by the Strathcona Dam (water levels raised 8.5 m in 1958 with construction of dam). Buttle Lake may be a barrier to dispersal or force marmots to disperse further to get around the lake; marmots have been document to disperse around the western end of the lake (8)",1,3,4,3,4,"Dispersing marmots have in the past created colonies in clearcuts, as early successional forests mimic alpine meadows. Post-logging succession decreases the quality of that habitat and with the eventual ingress of trees it can also create a greater risk of predation (3,10). Clearcuts are ephemeral habitat that decreases in quality for marmots as trees start to regrow. Colonies in these areas are extripated 5 - 10 years after establishment (11).",1,NA,3,5,3,4,NA,1,-1,-1,-1,3,"Loss of genetic diversity associated with a small population size may increase the susceptibility of marmots to disease. There are numerous potential ways in which non-native diseases could enter the marmot population, but the risk and potential impact is unknown. If a disease causes high mortality, it will probably have a large negative effect in a small area and then die out. If it causes morbidity but low mortality, it might become chronic in the population. Potential sources of non-native disease could be via other species of rodents (e.g. Yellow-bellied Marmot, Hoary Marmot) that are accidently transported to Vancouver Island via vehicles and goods, via domestic pets, such as dogs, that accompany humans into marmot habitat, or via humans recreating in and around marmot colonies. Another potential source of non-native disease is via the release of captive born marmots; both facilities where captive marmots are held are multispecies facilities, where marmots could come in contact with other mammal species, including rodents. They are also transported by air, and may encounter other mammal species in cargo holds. The disease risk associated with release of captive born marmots into the wild is minimized through quarantine at Mount Washington and health checks prior to release. (12)",1,3,5,3,4,"Predation by native predators (Cougar. Grey Wolf, Golden Eagle) accounts for the vast majority of mortality in marmots (1, 13). Predation on marmots will be greatly affected by the number of predators in the area of colonies; the number of predators will be variable and may depend on the number and behaviour of the primary prey of the predators (deer, elk, rabbits). In addition, if marmots are in a ""predator pit"" becuase of inverse density dependence at low population density (14), when marmots are below a threshold density, predators will regulate marmots. In a predator pit situation, above the threshold marmot density, predators will not regulate the population of marmots. The effect of predators is most likely reduced in areas of high human use because Cougar and Grey Wolf tend to avoid these areas. Predation can also be mitigated by management activities, including legal hunting and trapping. Population viability analysis has shown that marmot populations can persist long term if they experience relatively low mortality, as observed in the past (15). Indeed, the marmot population in the wild has increased in the recent past.",1,1,1,-1,3,"There have been at least six recorded instances of Yellow-bellied Marmot reaching Vancouver Island via accidental transport in vehicles and goods (lumber) (14). It is unlikely that the two species would hybridize even if in the same habitat. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that a Hoary Marmot could reach Vancouver Island through similar means. It might be possible for Hoary and Vancouver Island Marmot to hybridize as they are sister species and there is evidence of past genetic introgression of Hoary Marmot DNA in Vancouver Island Marmot (16).",1,-1,-1,-1,3,"Loss of genetic diversity associated with a small population size may increase the susceptibility of marmots to disease, but risk of exposure is unknown.",1,-1,-1,-1,3,"Loss of genetic diversity associated with a small population size may increase the susceptibility of marmots to disease, but risk of exposure is unknown.",1,-1,-1,-1,3,"Loss of genetic diversity associated with a small population size may increase the susceptibility of marmots to disease, but risk of exposure is unknown.",0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Marmots have been tested for chemical residues/toxins in the past.

Although there could be negative effects of avalanches on some marmots, avalanches also remove trees, thereby improving habitat. If avalanche frequency decreases (because of climate change) forest ingrowth may occur resulting in a reduction in marmot habitat. Such impacts could be mitigated through forest management (e.g., selective tree clearing in old avalanche chutes).",1,NA,2,3.5,2,4,NA,1,2,3.5,2,4,"Negative effects of habitat alteration, in the form of tree growth, have occurred and are expected to be large on a 20-year time scale (i.e., increased forest cover decreases the quality of habitat by increasing risk of predation) (6, 16) . The negative effects have and can be mitigated through removal of these trees. If mitigation continues, there is the potential for a positive effect through enhancement and creation of habitat. In the absence of mitigation, tree growth will have a negative effect. On a much longer time scale, habitat could be altered by climate change. Thelin et al.

Temperature extremes may also reduce snow pack persistence and whether winter precipitation is snow or rain, both of which may affect the metabolic cost of hibernation and overwinter survival.

Habitat management and restoration in the form of manual clearing of trees has occurred and is feasible at a small scale. In some areas on Vancouver Island, predation is reduced through regulated hunting and trapping of Grey Wolves and Cougars, as in the Nanaimo Lakes metapopulation. Since 2011, marmots living near the Mount Washington Alpine Resort have received supplemental food in the form of leaf-eater biscuits (Mazuri Exotic Animal Feed) to prevent their attraction to vegetation along the lower-elevation roadways in the spring. Supplemental food has also been provided to marmots at 1 to 9 colonies in the early spring to increase the number of pups weaned (Jackson et al. 2015; Jackson, pers. comm., 2016).

Captive-breeding to supplement the population has effectively mitigated the impacts of predation over the past 10 years and resulted in an increase in the marmot population. Modelling by Jackson et al. (2015) (1) suggests that continued captive breeding could have a similar result over the next 10 years. Some of the impacts of climate change can be mitigated (e.g., manual removal of tree ingrowth or supplemental feeding in case of drought) and may result in a net benefit to the species.",0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,1,2,1,3,Mount Washington,1,1,2,1,3,Mount Washington,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,-1,2,-1,3,All,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,-1,2,-1,3,All,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,3,4,3,4,All,1,-1,2,-1,3,All,1,2,3,2,4,Mount Washington,1,3,4,3,3,All,1,NA,3.5,5,3,4,All,1,-1,-1,-1,3,All,1,3.5,5,3,4,All,1,1,1,-1,3,All,1,-1,-1,-1,3,All,1,-1,-1,-1,3,All,1,-1,-1,-1,3,All,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,-1,5,-1,-1,All,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,-1,5,-1,-1,All,1,1,5,1,3,All,1,NA,2,3.5,2,4,All,1,2,3.5,2,4,All,1,-1,5,-1,3,All,1,-1,5,-1,3,All,1,-1,2,-1,3,All,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There is also a summer camp and new gravel beds near Mesachie Creek, but this is less important habitat (larvae are rarely found there). In Cowichan Lake, there is development in the southeastern portion of the lake, affecting spawning and rearing habitat near Sutton Creek and Meades Creek. The spawning and rearing habitat along the northwest shoreline does not appear to be strongly affected by development. Overall, we estimate about 11-30% of the population may be threatened by changes to spawning and rearing habitat in developed areas.

Persecution of Vancouver Lamprey - All of most Vancouver Lamprey adults are potentially affected by persecution by anglers in Cowichan and Mesachie lakes. Severity:Consumptive use of host species - Coho Salmon escapement from Cowichan Lake has decreased approximately 73% since the 1950s. Overfishing may contribute to this decline, although decreased survival of Coho at sea also contributes. In other parasitic lamprey species, lamprey abundance declines with declines in host availability. However, we do not know exactly how much the Vancouver Lamprey population varies with availability of Coho Salmon. Ability to switch to other hosts (e.g., Cutthroat Trout) may provide a buffer. Persecution of Vancouver Lamprey - Angler-induced mortality is thought to be high (i.e., of those caught attached to fish), but the total number of lamprey killed by anglers is unknown and likely relatively low or low-moderate. Timing:Consumptive use of host species - Although Coho Salmon in Cowichan Lake have not been monitored since 2006, the decline in Coho (relative to their historical abundance) appears to be ongoing. Persecution of Vancouver Lamprey - Killing of Vancouver Lamprey adults by anglers is an ongoing threat. Persecution and bycatch accounted for here but host persecution is accounted for 6.3. persecution is not a threat for this species since anglers are not targetting Lampreys.

Wildfires are considered part of the natural ecosystem processes of Canada's grasslands, and historically wildfires were important in maintaining native grasslands. At present, native grasslands areas are confined to very small areas, many of which are highly isolated from one another, and usually with only sporadic wildfire events. Verna’s Flower Moth is recorded from localities where wildfires in these and potential habitats have the potential to directly and severely impact local moth populations (e.g., Swengel 1996). Here the direct impact of fire at a temporal level is considered, as it is likely that wildfires occurring only at critical times in the life history of the moth (i.e., adult flight and larval feeding; May-July) would have negative consequences to moth populations; it is during this time when the host plant is flowering and may contain the feeding larva. Once the larvae finish feeding, they drop to the soil and burrow, likely offering protection from fire except under extreme intensities.",0,NA,NA,NA,NA,Not applicable.,0,0,5,0,4,"Other ecosystem modifications that serve to create light to moderate disturbance and/or disrupt natural ecological succession are likely beneficial to Antennaria populations and may serve to create habitat for the moth. This would include both natural and prescribed burning during times when the moth is not flying or feeding. Hotter fires would likely impact populations of mature plants, but seed banks would likely survive. In general, light fire would be beneficial. Again, timing is the main issue; if fire or other ecosystem modifications occur when host plants are flowering and the larva are feeding, then the impact would be negative.",1,NA,2,5,2,4,NA,1,2,5,2,4,(See Threats Section),1,2,2.5,3,4,(See Threats Section),0,NA,NA,NA,NA,Not applicable.,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,-1,3,-1,4,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,Not applicable.,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,Not applicable.,1,-1,3,-1,4,"Most of the prairies are under agricultural production, and thus agricultural effluents are routinely applied to crops.

For other early-emerging lycaenid species advanced emergence dates in response to climate warming have been observed (Polgar et al. 2013; Swengel and Swengel 2014), so synchrony of emergence of Verna’s Flower Moth with its host plant(s) may also be affected.

2.to assess and quantify threats for this species, develop mitigation measures, and assess the effectiveness of this mitigation
3.to clarify patterns of abundance, connectivity, and population and distribution trends across the species’ British Columbia range; and
4.to clarify the species’ distribution, particularly the knowledge gaps about how patchy their distribution is, and the extent to which the species uses upper canopy habitats in British Columbia

Ensure sufficient habitat is protectedx within private and Crown forestry lands. An effective way to accomplish this is to list the Wandering Salamander as a species at risk that requires special management attention to address the impacts of forest and range activities under the Forest and Range Practices Act. Work in collaboration with resource ministries and land managers to review existing forestry retention practices and strategies to determine whether retention is sufficient to ensure long-term availability of large logs in appropriate decay classes for breeding. This will involve predictive modeling. It may also involve better guidance or enforcement of existing regulations. Decrease threats to the species by reducing the rate of forest clearing and conversion, and road and trail construction. Tsunamis cannot be mitigated, but Habitat protection measures will help to secure the species if such stochastic events destroy nearshore populations. Raise awareness about the importance of retaining large downed wood in appropriate decay classes to provide habitat on private lands. Encourage relocation of large downed wood and stumps before any construction or habitat conversion occurs. This will involve developing and delivering educational materials to the public and to consultants who conduct environmental impact assessments. Learn more about the actual impacts of threats that are currently poorly understood for this species, especially introduced disease, invasive species, pollution, and climate change. Develop and test mitigation for these, as well as the threat of logging. This will involve research. Both extensive and intensive monitoring activities are needed. Revisit historical sites and their surroundings to determine persistence and overall trends in the species’ distribution. Monitor persistence, relative abundance, and age structure at selected occurrences across the species’ range by conducting standardized surveys (for example, artificial cover-board plots). Use occupancy modeling to account for detectability. Use genetic tools to understand connectivity among the patchily distributed subpopulations. This will result in either managing subpopulations separately or aiming to re-establish connectivity among historically interbreeding populations. Clarify the species’ distribution on the Sunshine Coast and elsewhere throughout its range by conducting standardized surveys that account for detectability (for example, occupancy modeling). Develop a habitat suitability model to guide search efforts and identify knowledge gaps. Clarify the extent of canopy habitat use by surveying the canopies of large trees, especially in very moist forests, such as on the west coast of Vancouver Island. 
",1,"Research, Monitoring, Education, Protection, Habitat restoration,","Ameliorating the impacts of longer summer droughts may be feasible, but any mitigation actions will require design and testing (Shoo et al. 2011). Possibilities include supplementing artificial shelter (for example, pipes, cover boards) in open habitats to reduce desiccation and thermal stress, and thinning treatments in second-growth forests to accelerate the growth of large trees and late-successional forest conditions, which may be better at buffering climate extremes. Ensure sufficient habitat is protected within private and Crown forestry lands. An effective way to accomplish this is to list the Wandering Salamander as a species at risk that requires special management attention to address the impacts of forest and range activities under the Forest and Range Practices Act.

A number of objectives are proposed to meet the maintenance and recovery goal and address threats to the survival of the species. The recovery objectives are as follows: identify and protect critical habitat for remaining genetically pure populations; improve knowledge of population genetics, size, distribution, and trends; identify opportunities to help recover genetically pure and near-genetically pure populations of westslope cutthroat trout, partly by restoring habitat and eliminating or suppressing populations of non-native fish that are having negative impacts on westslope cutthroat trout; increase education and awareness of westslope cutthroat trout for their conservation; re-establish genetically pure populations of westslope cutthroat trout in sites within their historical range that recognizes the diversity of their life history strategies in Alberta. While the recovery team discussed a target number of populations, it was decided that too many unknowns currently exist (for example, feasibility of recovering populations in areas with non-natives and success of suppression efforts) to provide a realistic number at this time; determine the role that introduced genetically pure westslope cutthroat trout may play in the recovery effort
More details : Current angling regulations are highly restrictive, and would appear to permit very little legal harvest of native or potentially native remnant populations, in part because of high minimum size limits in many stream populations that make them effectively catch-and-release only fisheries. Targeted removal of non-native species (complete removal or suppression) will be evaluated in systems which might have some chance of success. As stocking records are unclear or ambiguous in many instances, professional judgment will also be considered for some populations, (that is, where stocking has occurred on top of genetically pure, native populations or where a stocking location is unclear such as above or below a barrier). This may include introduced genetically pure populations both inside and outside of native range if they do not fit under Sportfishing populations but have high conservation value. In some circumstances Conservation populations may be managed through periodic stocking for the purpose of maintaining a genetic refugium, or when “genetic swamping” is being attempted to increase the purity level of the population. the upper Corral Creek watershed in Banff National Park will be the site of a pilot multi-year restoration proposed to commence in 2011 (re-establish westslope cutthroat trout in the headwater lake and stream above a natural waterfall barrier).  Reduce the potential for illegal introductions and cease stocking of native or non-native species where they can negatively impact recovery or survival of westslope cutthroat trout.
",1,"Research, Re-establishing populations,","Conduct studies to better understand the potential threats associated with human activities including water regulation, connectivity/fragmentation, land-use practices, resource extraction, species introductions, climate change, angling and cumulative effects. Review current work on climate change specific to the range of westslope cutthroat trout and determine how recommendations from these studies can be incorporated into future recovery efforts. Classify and prioritize existing stream and lake populations according to status of threats and determine where populations can be restored, improved or re-established. Determine how threat elimination and mitigation might contribute to an increase in genetically pure populations that are sustainable and resilient. Threats: invasive species, adverse effects on habitat, consumptive use/exploitation, stocking, pollution and climate change.

1.	protect and manage habitat to maintain extant populations in Ontario
2.	determine current distribution and abundance of Wild Hyacinth populations in Ontario through inventory and monitoring in association with other Carolinian woodland plant species at risk
3.	address knowledge gaps relating to their biology, ecology, habitat and threats
4.	determine feasibility of reintroduction, and reintroduce Wild Hyacinth populations to suitable historical sites and recovery habitat; and
5.	prepare and disseminate information on best management practices for Wild Hyacinth
It is recommended that an occupancy-based approach be used to define the area to be regulated as habitat under the ESA. Given that Wild Hyacinth does not occupy all apparently suitable habitat at the few extant Ontario sites, it is recommended that the area occupied by the plants, as well as surrounding habitat required for dispersal and population expansion, be prescribed as habitat in the regulation. The area prescribed should be delineated as the full extent of the Ecological Land Classification (ELC) ecosite polygon within which a population occurs.  A control program for the Double-crested Cormorant was initiated in 2008 with the aim of reducing impacts of the nesting colony on the site's vegetation and associate species at risk. Develop and implement best management practices for maintaining or improving Wild Hyacinth habitat by removing invasive species, maintaining semi-open forest conditions during flowering, and preventing inadvertent trampling.

•        More info : A Bison Disease Technical Workshop was held in 2005 to examine the technical feasibility of eliminating bovine diseases from the Wood Buffalo National Park ecosystem (Shury et al. 2006). Studies have been completed on vaccines for Brucella abortus in both bison and cattle (Clapp et al. 2011, Treanor et al. 2010, Denisov et al. 2010, Hu et al. 2009, 2010), and studies are being planned to look at effectiveness of vaccine for tuberculosis in bison. Develop a contingency plan for disease and genetic management in the event a disease-free local population becomes infected with bovine tuberculosis and/or brucellosis Several reintroduced free-ranging local populations (Aishihik, Hay Zama, Mackenzie) currently have highly managed hunts, where quotas are determined by the province/territory for both the Indigenous and non-Indigenous hunts. Quotas are based on herd population dynamics and socioeconomic factors to manage herd expansion and increase public acceptance. Recommendations for use of fire in the management of Wood Bison have been proposed (Fort Nelson First Nation and Shifting Mosaics Consulting 2015). Manage genetic integrity by preventing free-ranging Plains Bison, domestic bison, and cattle from hybridizing with Wood Bison through controlling, eliminating and/or preventing incursion of these animals into areas with Wood Bison. ~4,363 Wood Bison in nine free-ranging, disease-free local populations plus 300 individuals in one public, captive, disease-free local population managed for conservation.

1.	fisheries and habitat management: adopt or maintain fisheries and habitat management practices that are beneficial to Yelloweye Rockfish and which ensure total fishery removals remain at sustainable levels
2.	assessment and monitoring: maintain and develop strategies to assess and monitor the status of Yelloweye Rockfish populations, and the effectiveness of established protection measures

4.	outreach and communication: support communication and outreach activities aimed at mitigating threats and reducing mortality of Yelloweye Rockfish
In 2002, the Inshore Rockfish Conservation Strategy (Yamanaka and Logan 2010) introduced four key principles for the conservation and recovery of inshore rockfish species (Yelloweye, Quillback, China, Tiger, and Copper Rockfish), to: account for all rockfish catch; decrease fishing mortality; establish rockfish protection areas; improve stock assessment and fishery monitoring
The pollution prevention provisions of the Fisheries Act include prohibitions against the deposit of deleterious substances into waters frequented by fish. Proposed amendments made in 2018 to the Fisheries Act include fisheries protection provisions that prohibit the destruction or harmful alteration of fish habitat. Both of these prohibitions apply to coastal and marine development activities that could occur in or near the habitats of Yelloweye Rockfish. The 100% at-sea and dockside monitoring of the commercial groundfish fishery allows for strict enforcement of licence conditions of these fisheries. Validated at-sea and dockside information is used to enforce bycatch and quota limits as well as timing and location of fishing activities.  On-the-water fisheries enforcement activities as well as DFO’s Air Surveillance Program allows Fishery Officers to check for illegal harvesting practices (for example, contravening time or area closures and species’ limits).

support of the recovery goal.
1. Monitor habitat to detect potential threats at all three sites of occurrence annually (or
more frequently) and address causal agents.
2. Maintain or increase current population size (measured as area occupied by moss and
number of colonies) at each site of occurrence by protecting plants and critical habitat.
3. Identify broad-scale conservation initiatives in the Carolinean life zone relevant to the
Spoon-leaved Moss and identify activities on which to collaborate.
4. Increase the knowledge base with respect to species demography, biology, distribution,
abundance, habitat requirements, critical habitat, threats, transplant/introduction
techniques, and/or feasibility of recovery to the extent that long-term sustainability is
confirmed or that:
4.1. Recovery goals and activities necessary for long term persistence of Spoon-leaved
Moss populations, as outlined in this document, are supported or can be justifiably
modified,
4.2. The necessity/feasibility of restoring population size and/or number can be
assessed.

Bark Beetles were identified as being a potentially significant cause of mortality in stressed trees and on sites with high solar radiation (Wong 2012). Pine Leaf Adelgid (Pineus pinifoliae) also kills and damages Whitebark Pine in areas where it co-occurs with White or Engelmann Spruce. There are also a variety of other native insects and pathogens that may reduce tree vigour (increasing susceptibility to other stressors) or kill trees outright (S. Haeussler pers. comm. 2013).

Dredging and waterfowl habitat creation likely occurs within many protected management areas.",1,NA,3.5,4,4,4,NA,1,3.5,4,4,4,"The invasive plant Phragmites australis ssp. australis has already overtaken several southwestern Ontario Spotted Turtle sites and is expected to spread throughout southern Ontario over the next 20 years. No wetlands are immune to invasive Phragmitesand climate change is helping to increase its rate and extent of spread. Some Spotted Turtles and other turtle species have been found stuck or dead within dense stands. Lake Erie coastal wetlands, even those that are isolated from anthropogenic disturbance, have been rapidly overtaken by this invasive plant in the last 10 years. Observations of Spotted Turtles in these areas have dropped >50-90%. The coastal wetlands of Georgian Bay are likely to be invaded by this species with the continued drop in water levels due to climate change. Invasive Phragmites limits turtle movement and basking opportunities; it reduces nesting habitat availability; it lowers nest incubation temperatures, nest success, and survival of hatchlings overwintering in the nest chamber; and it increases the risk of fire and drought in wetlands. Once Phragmites becomes established in dense mono-cultural stands the habitat is rendered unusable and is equivalent to habitat loss.",1,-1,-1,-1,3,Some populations occur in human-influenced landscapes with increased numbers of subsidized predators (i.e. mammals that become more abundant due to increased resources provided by humans). Turtle studies in these areas have found up to 80-100% nest depredation rates for other turtle species and it is assumed that Spotted Turtle nests experience similar rates of depredation.

Lowered water levels and harsher winters resultant from climate change may exacerbate overwintering mortality through increasing the occurrence of anoxic and freezing conditions within hibernation sites.
