The average out of sample performace is, as it turns out, a good representation of the log-score of a model. What does this look like?

It weights each sample by the inverse probabilty of the omitted observation, then takes their normalized sum as a new value, $lppd_{IS}$. As it turns out, the distribution of the largest weights calculated for each $y_i$ should have a [Pareto distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution), with each $y_i$ having an estimated Pareto $k$ parameter. For observations with $k>0.7$, there is evidence the Pareto distribution is failing and that the observation is highly inflential, given the proposed model."
